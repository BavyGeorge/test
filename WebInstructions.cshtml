Our project is a kind of public usage website.

hi guys just  checking a few posts, I see your questions.
So kind of like seek and Summer of Tech sites (I gave login, so we can see structure, but not student details and skillsets until I pay for it) 
employers with accounts can see interns apprentices.

[17:33, 27/08/2020] +64 274 888 069: 
but also the students owner/tertiary can apply skills learnt to student and supervisor, 
there will then be hours captured and report from student and supervisor and employer.

I would say five login levels maybe.
Admin, Student, Supervisor, Institute, Employer.       Given by Will.
